<p>A  C++  developer  cannot  compile  C++  code  and  share  the  object  file  with  other  C++  developers  on  the 
same platform and know that the result will 
compile and link correctly
.
Our status quo is that two source files a.cpp and b.cpp can only be linked together if they are compiled with both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the same version of the same compiler, or another compiler with a compatibility mode; and</li>
  <li>compatible switch settings, since most C++ compilers offer incompatible switch settings where even compiling two files with the same version of the same compiler will not link successfully</li>
</ul>
